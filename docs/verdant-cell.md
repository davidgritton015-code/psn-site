# Verdant Cell — Hydroponic Grow Shelf (Project 2)

**Goal:** Quiet, reliable indoor grow shelf with time-based light cycles and basic env monitoring.

## Hardware (selected)
- Arduino UNO → migrate to Nano after prototype
- 8-Channel 5V Relay Module (optocoupled)
- DS3231 RTC for light cycles
- SHT31-D for temp/humidity
- Barrina T5 full-spectrum LED strips (1 ft, 4-pack)
- 6-switch waterproof manual overrides
- Dual-row terminal strips for neat 12V distribution

## Notes
- Fan noise not critical in this install
- Start with breadboard, then hard-mount inside stud bay
- Power switching: likely bypass strip toggles via relays
