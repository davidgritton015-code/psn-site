# **PSN Master Document**

*Project Summary & Navigation Index*

---

## **Project Overview**

**PSN (Personal Sustainability Network)** is a decentralized, modular approach to building self-reliant infrastructure. Each **Node** represents a physical site, and each Node can host one or more **Projects**. Projects are documented in Phases that move from concept to installation and operation.

This document serves as the **top-level navigation hub** for all PSN projects.

### **Project 1: Ember Core (EC)**

**Summary:** Modular solar charging station designed for durability, accessibility, and scalability. Serves as a proof-of-concept for off-grid energy systems and as the first functional Node power source.

### **Project 1: The Verdant Cell (VC)**

**Summary:** Build a modular, embedded environmental automation system within the motorcycle shed, focused on supporting a small hydroponic grow shelf. This is PSN Project 2, evolving from Ember Core’s solar backbone into micro-environment automation.

Once this PSN Master Doc is in place, **each Project Master Document** will follow the same style:

* Header

* Short summary of the project

* Phase 1, 2, 3 (etc.) quick descriptions \+ links to docs in each phase

* Maybe a small image to make scanning easier
