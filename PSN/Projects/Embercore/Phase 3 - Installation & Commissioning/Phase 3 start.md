**✅ Completed:**

* Phase 3 physical install — system is up and running in a semi-permanent location.

* Phase 2 build document finalized at a good “middle ground” skill level.

* Skills Corner page created as a parallel resource for targeted learning without bloating the main doc.

**📌 Next Steps:**

* **Phase 3 Documentation**

  * Shorter, simpler, and more narrative-driven.

  * Focus on *this* implementation — the “why” behind location, mounting choices, routing, etc.

  * Highlight differences from Phase 2 instructions so people see it as adaptable, not prescriptive.

  * Include key decision points so future users can map their own needs against yours.

**🗒 Style/Structure for Phase 3 Doc:**

* **Intro:** Quick context — what you were trying to achieve with this installation.

* **Implementation Walkthrough:** Picture \+ caption format, each with a sentence or two of reasoning.

* **Notable Deviations from Phase 2:** Bullet out anything you did differently.

* **Lessons Learned / Gotchas:** “If I did it again…” section.

* **Future Adaptability Notes:** Things you’d change if location or needs were different.
