# **Project PSN ‚Äì The Ember Core**

## **Phase 3 Wrap-Up ‚Äì Installation & Application**

### **Overview**

Phase 3 marked the transition of the Ember Core project from bench-top assembly into a **fully installed and operational solar charging station.** Building upon the conceptual foundation of Phase 1 and the assembly efforts of Phase 2, this phase focused on physical installation, system integration, and first-time application under real-world conditions.

### **‚úÖ Achievements**

* **Project Board Mounted:** Cleanly installed inside the shed for accessibility and protection.  
* **Solar Panels Integrated:** Panels placed for initial use, routed, and connected into the charge controller with proper breaker sequencing.  
* **Battery & Inverter Installed:** Battery mounted level on a 2x4 base, inverter wall-mounted above, and connections fused for safety.  
* **AC Distribution Added:** Surge-protected power strip hardwired into the inverter output for multiple AC outlets.  
* **12V LED Lighting:** Four low-draw LED lights installed with a marine-grade switch, integrated into the 12V distribution.  
* **System Power-On:** Full energization achieved ‚Äî solar charging, battery storage, inverter AC output, and load distribution validated.  
* **First Real Load:** Heat gun test confirmed the inverter‚Äôs ability to handle high-demand AC devices, marking the system‚Äôs transition from proof-of-concept to practical application.

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Practices Reinforced**

* Breakers must be **disabled during installs** to prevent accidental energization.  
* Batteries are **always live** ‚Äî improper tool placement across terminals risks fire and permanent damage.  
* **Fusing the inverter positive lead** is critical to prevent catastrophic failure.  
* **Polarity and grounding** must be double-checked when wiring AC distribution.  
* **Sequential power-up** ensures controlled system energization and simplifies troubleshooting.

### **üí° Lessons & Philosophy**

* **Temporary vs Permanent:** Certain choices (solar placement, battery enclosure) were intentionally left temporary for flexibility. Permanent enclosures and mounts will come in future phases.  
* **DC First Mentality:** Prioritizing 12V DC loads (like lighting) preserves limited inverter capacity and simplifies scalability by expanding battery banks rather than upgrading AC hardware.  
* **Cable Discipline:** Consistent routing, clamps, and service loops maintained across the system create a professional, safe, and expandable build.

### **üöÄ Path Forward**

Phase 3 completes the **initial installation milestone** of Ember Core. While this closes out Project 1‚Äôs first build cycle, the Ember Core framework is designed for growth. Future phases may include:

* Permanent solar panel mounting with weatherproofing.  
* Battery enclosures and bank expansion.  
* Additional AC and 12V load integration.  
* Continued documentation to establish Ember Core as a **modular, replicable system template.**
