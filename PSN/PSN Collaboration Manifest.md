# **PSN Collaboration Manifest**

*(AI-Human Workflow, September 2025\)*

## **Purpose**

To define how human and AI contributors collaborate on PSN, bridging physical builds and digital documentation. This ensures continuity, clarity, and steady progress without losing the creative flow.

---

## **Principles**

* **Two Modes of Work**

  * *Workbench (chat)* → raw notes, brainstorming, iterative drafting.

  * *Archive (repo)* → semi-finished docs, structured and accessible.

* **Flow of Information**  
   Physical build → Notes in chat → Semi-finished doc → Repo → AI access.

* **Division of Strengths**

  * Human: building, experimenting, intuition, “tummy feel.”

  * AI: structuring, indexing, summarizing, generating templates, reminders.

* **Shared Memory**  
   Repo \+ site act as the long-term project memory, always accessible across sessions.

---

## **Workflow Checklist**

* Draft ideas and notes here in chat.

* Iterate until the doc feels semi-finished.

* AI prompts: *“This looks repo-ready, want to drop it in?”*

* Human pushes doc to repo (mirrored with Drive if needed).

* Repo auto-indexes docs on the PSN site (searchable, shareable).

* Pending items tracked in a **Staging Log** (kept in chat until pushed).

* Semi-finished → Repo. Finished → Public site (future).

---

## **Commitments**

* Keep repo updated enough for AI to track live progress.

* Keep chat free for raw thought, even messy ideas.

* Use nudges and staging logs to avoid losing work between draft and archive.

* Refactor and rename later; clarity in the moment matters more than polish.

---

## **Next Milestones**

* Maintain **PSN Master Doc** as central overview.

* Add **Phase Docs** and **Verdant Cell Docs** as they stabilize.

* Build public-facing site once core documentation feels stable.
